## Introduction

**[Infisical](https://infisical.com)** is the open source secret management platform that teams use to centralize their secrets like API keys, database credentials, and configurations.

We're on a mission to make secret management more accessible to everyone, not just security teams, and that means redesigning the entire developer experience from ground up.

## Features

- **[User-friendly dashboard](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/project)** to manage secrets across projects and environments (e.g. development, production, etc.). 
- **[Client SDKs](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/overview)** to fetch secrets for your apps and infrastructure on demand. 
- **[Infisical CLI](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview)** to fetch and inject secrets into any framework in local development and CI/CD. 
- **[Infisical API](https://infisical.com/docs/api-reference/overview/introduction)** to perform CRUD operation on secrets, users, projects, and any other resource in Infisical. 
- **[Native integrations](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/overview)** with platforms like [GitHub](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/cicd/githubactions), [Vercel](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/cloud/vercel), [AWS](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/cloud/aws-secret-manager), and tools like [Terraform](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/frameworks/terraform), [Ansible](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/platforms/ansible), and more. 
- **[Infisical Kubernetes operator](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/getting-started/kubernetes)** to managed secrets in k8s, automatically reload deployments, and more.
- **[Infisical Agent](https://infisical.com/docs/infisical-agent/overview)** to inject secrets into your applications without modifying any code logic. 
- **[Self-hosting and on-prem](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/overview)** to get complete control over your data.
- **[Secret versioning](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/secret-versioning)** and **[Point-in-Time Recovery](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/pit-recovery)** to version every secret and project state. 
- **[Audit logs](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/audit-logs)** to record every action taken in a project. 
- **[Role-based Access Controls](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/role-based-access-controls)** to create permission sets on any resource in Infisica and assign those to user or machine identities. 
- **[Simple on-premise deployments](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/overview)** to AWS, Digital Ocean, and more.
- **[Secret Scanning and Leak Prevention](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/scanning-overview)** to prevent secrets from leaking to git. 

And much more.
